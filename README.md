# movies
Allows syncing various movie watchlists. 

Ultimately, should sync Letterboxd, IMDB, JustWatch, TMDB, prime. The idea is that I can mark movies as watched in 
letterboxd and the other services will be aware. Also, will be able to watch a movie in prime and have it marked in 
letterboxd.

## todo
- Export data from prime watched history page
- Import data into letterboxd
